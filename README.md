# YouToDo

A Flask application written in Python, allowing users to save reminders and store the data using the MongoDB database.
To sure user safety and privacy, I implemented log-in security, encrypting user authentication information before uploading the information to MongoDB.
The application is deployed using the Heroku Cloud Application Platform.
